# Save the script to a file, for example patch-management.sh
# Make the file executable with the following command:
# chmod +x patch-management.sh

# Schedule the script to run every 10 days with cron by adding the following line to your crontab:
# 0 0 */10 * * /path/to/patch-management.sh

# The script itself:

# Log the start of the script to a file
echo "Patch management started on $(date)" >> /var/log/patch-management.log

# Run the actual patch management commands
apt-get update && apt-get upgrade -y

# Log the completion of the script to a file
echo "Patch management completed on $(date)" >> /var/log/patch-management.log

# Add the cron job to the crontab
(crontab -l ; echo "0 0 */10 * * $(realpath $0)") | crontab -

# Check if the cron job has been added successfully
crontab -l | grep "$(realpath $0)"

# This script will run the apt-get update and apt-get upgrade -y commands every 10 days, at midnight (0 0), log the start and completion times 
# to a file at /var/log/patch-management.log, and add the line to the crontab. If the line has been added successfully, 
# the script will output the line from the crontab.
